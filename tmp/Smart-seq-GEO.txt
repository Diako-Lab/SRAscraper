(Submitter supplied) The plasticity and heterogeneity of cancer cells are known to play a major role in malignant progression, yet the precise molecular drivers of metastases remain elusive. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) on tumours and matched lung macrometastases of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of breast cancer to identify molecular mechanisms of metastasis during colonization.

3. Single cell RNA-seq of primary human glioblastomas
(Submitter supplied) We report transcriptomes from 430 single glioblastoma cells isolated from 5 individual tumors and 102 single cells from gliomasphere cells lines generated using SMART-seq. In addition, we report population RNA-seq from the five tumors as well as RNA-seq from cell lines derived from 3 tumors (MGH26, MGH28, MGH31) cultured under serum free (GSC) and differentiated (DGC) conditions. This dataset highlights intratumoral heterogeneity with regards to the expression of de novo derived transcriptional modules and established subtype classifiers.

4. Single-cell analysis reveals the landscape of tumor heterogeneity and identifies MLXIPL as a potential biomarker in tumor evolution trajectory of hepatocellular carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a globally prevailing cancer with a low five-year survival rate. Little is known about its intricate gene expression profile and tumor evolutionary traits. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an indispensable tool to explore the genetic characteristics at the single-cell level. In this study, we profiled gene expression of single cells from human HCC tumor and para-tumor tissues using Smart-seq 2 sequencing method. more...

5. Loss of CSL unlocks a hypoxic response and enhanced tumor growth potential in breast cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Notch signaling is an important regulator of stem cell differentiation. All canonical Notch signaling is transmitted through the DNA-binding protein CSL and hyperactivated Notch signaling is associated with tumor development; thus it may be anticipated that CSL deficiency should reduce tumor growth. In contrast, we report that genetic removal of CSL in breast tumor cells caused accelerated growth of xenografted tumors. more...

7. TARGET-seq: novel method for single-cell mutational analysis and parallel RNA-sequencing [validation in cell lines; Figure 2 and Figure S3]
(Submitter supplied) We developed TARGET-seq, a single-cell genotyping and RNA-seq method, which allows accurate detection of multiple mutations within single-cells from genomic and coding DNA in parallel with whole transcriptome analysis, providing a powerful tool to link transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity. Single cell whole transcriptome analysis of JURKAT, SET2 and HSPCs using SMART-seq+, mRNA targeting (tSMARTseq) or TARGET-seq reveals very good correlations between methods.

11. Cancer cells enter an adaptive persistence to survive radiotherapy and repopulate tumor 1
(Submitter supplied) Tumor cell repopulation represents a critical factor in the failure of radiotherapy. Analogous to the concept of “drug-tolerant persistence (DTP)” in stress of chemo- or targeted therapy, here, we show that cancer cells enter a “radiation-tolerant persistence (RTP)” to survive radiotherapy and repopulate tumor. These RTP cells exhibit a distinct phenotype characterized by enlargement of cell sizes and nucleus, complex karyotype, cell cycle arrest and engagement of quiescence. more...

13. Clonal replacement of tumor-specific T cells following PD-1 blockade [bulk RNA]
(Submitter supplied) Immunotherapies that block inhibitory checkpoint receptors on T cells have transformed the clinical care of cancer patients. However, the clonal origin of tumor-specific T cells following checkpoint blockade in patients remains unclear. Here, we performed paired single-cell RNA- and T cell receptor (TCR)- sequencing on site-matched tumors from patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) pre- and post-anti-PD-1 therapy. more...

14. Optimized high-order low-dose drug mixtures boost selectivity and efficacy of colorectal carcinoma treatment
(Submitter supplied) Colorectal carcinoma is currently treated with a combination of chemotherapeutics, often supplemented with targeted drugs. Despite recent improvements, an urgent need exists for improved efficacy, especially at late stage disease, and minimized side effects. Therefore, we employed the recently developed mathematical approach of the phenotypically-driven therapeutically guided multidrug optimization (TGMO) technology, to identify individualized optimal drug combinations (ODCs). more...

17. BiTE-secreting T cells effectively target ovarian cancer and prolong antitumor immunity by persisting in the extratumoral peritoneal cavity
(Submitter supplied) Cancer immunotherapies can produce complete therapeutic responses, however outcomes in ovarian cancer (OC) are modest and while adoptive transfer of engineered T cells (ACT) has been evaluated in OC, durable effects are rarely observed. T cells lacking tumor specificity (bystander T cells) readily accumulate in tumors and leveraging bystander T cell activity represents a promising opportunity to enhance antitumor immunity following ACT. more...
