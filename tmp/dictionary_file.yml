            \  Tissue samples were placed in separate labeled containers containing\
            \ Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium and transported in regular\
            \ ice to the laboratory. The CPTs were transported at room temperature.\
            \ Overall transit time in all cases was less than 1 hour (from specimen\
            \ extraction to cell dissociation) and the tissue samples were always\
            \ kept in this medium. The chRCC patient was an 84-year-old female with\
            \ stage III disease and was treatment-na\xEFve at the time of sample collection.,RNA\
            \ libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols.\
            \  A suspension of 10,000 FACS sorted live cells in 1X PBS (calcium and\
            \ magnesium free) containing 0.04% BSA (Sigma) were used as input to the\
            \ 10X chromium controller system (10x Genomics Inc., product code 120223).\
            \ Cells were barcoded using the 10x\u2122 GemCode\u2122 Technology to\
            \ separately index each cell\u2019s transcriptome by partitioning them\
            \ into Gel Bead-in-EMulsions (GEMs). GEMs were generated by combining\
            \ barcoded Single Cell 5\u2019 Gel Beads, RT Master Mix with cells, and\
            \ Partitioning Oil on a microfluidic chip. The GEM RT reaction was performed\
            \ in thermocycler (53\xB0C for 45 minutes, 85\xB0C for 5 minutes, 4\xB0\
            C hold overnight). After RT incubation, the GEMs were broken, and the\
            \ first strand of cDNA was recovered using DynaBeadsR MyOne\u2122 Silane\
            \ beads. 2 \u2013 50 ng of amplified cDNA and the target enriched product\
            \ respectively were used as input for library construction. Fragmentation,\
            \ end repair and A tailing were performed to obtain final libraries containing\
            \ the P5 and P7 priming sites used in IlluminaR sequencing. High sensitivity\
            \ DNA chips and the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) were\
            \ used for 5\u2019 gene expression quality control and quantification.\
            \ Quality control was performed twice before sequencing. The 5\u2019 gene\
            \ expression library was sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 S1 with sequencing\
            \ depth of approximately 300-500 million reads per sample. For the mouse\
            \ dataset, live, CD45+CD3-NK1.1+ innate lymphocytes from the pooled tumors\
            \ of one PyMT mouse were sorted into 1X PBS containing 0.04% BSA. Library\
            \ preparation, quality control and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed\
            \ by the Integrated Genomics Operations Core of Sloan Kettering Institute\
            \ at MSKCC."

          - "Peripheral blood and tumor tissues for scRNA-seq were obtained from healthy\
            \ individuals and NSCLC patients who underwent a surgery for curative\
            \ resection at the National Cancer Center Hospital East. Each Treg cell\
            \ subset [Naive Treg cells (CD45RA+CD25lowFoxP3low CD4+) and eTreg cells\
            \ (CD45RA\u2013CD25highFoxP3highCD4+)] was sorted with a BD FACSAria Fusion\
            \ Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for subsequent scRNA- seq\
            \ analyses. Naive Treg cells and eTreg cells from healthy individuals\u2019\
            \ PBMCs, normal lung tissues, and cancer patients\u2019 TILs were purified\
            \ for scRNA-seq analyses using Ficoll-Paque or Tumor Tissue Dissociation\
            \ Reagent (BD Biosciences), which enzymatically dissociate tissues as\
            \ previously described (PMID: 35852944  ).  Normal lung tissues were resected\
            \ from the same lung lobe as the lung tumor, but from the area farthest\
            \ from the tumor (at least >5 cm from the tumor). Because of the limited\
            \ number of Treg cells in the normal lung tissues, both Treg cells (CD45RA-CD25highCD4+\
            \ T cells) and CD8+ T cells (CD45RA-CCR7-CD8+) in normal lung tissues\
            \ were sorted, and then CD8+ T cells were bioinformatically removed from\
            \ the downstream analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Anti-CD3 (clone:\
            \ UCTH1), anti-CD4 (clone: RPA-T4) and anti-CD45RA (clone: HI100) mAbs\
            \ were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-CCR7 (clone: G043H7) and anti-CD25\
            \ (clone: BC96) mAbs were obtained from BioLegend (San Diego, CA). Fixable\
