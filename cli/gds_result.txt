(Submitter supplied) Brown adipocytes, muscle and dorsal dermis descend from precursor cells in the dermomyotome, but the factors that regulate commitment to the brown adipose lineage are unknown. Here, we prospectively isolated and determined the molecular profile of embryonic brown preadipose cells. Brown adipogenic precursor activity in embryos was confined to PdgfrÎ±+, Myf5Cre-lineage-marked cells. RNAseq analysis identified Early B Cell Factor-2 (Ebf2) as one of the most selectively expressed genes in this cell fraction. more...
